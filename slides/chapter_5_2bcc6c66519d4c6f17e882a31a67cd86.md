Good morning everyone, in this lesson we will learn about loops. In programming loops repeats a command for a number of times.


---
## Types of loops:

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0e067e1995"
```

`@part1`
For Loops 

While Loops


`@script`
There are two types of loops and they are the for loop and the while loop. Below is what a for loop looks like. After the for there is a sequence  and in between the brackets a statement will occur x amount of times depending on the length of the sequence.

## For Loop

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "8ab4f140a7"
```

`@part1`
for (val in sequence)
{
statement
}


`@script`

## Example of a For Loop

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "1aab9cae62"
```

`@part1`
for (val in sequence)
{
statement
}


`@script`



---
## While Loop

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2e20b66c8c"
```

`@part1`
Unlike the for loop the while loop repeats a command when certain conditions are met.  This comes in handy when


`@script`

## Example of a While Loop

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e84b524b91"
```

`@part1`



`@script`

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "9de0b20d6c"
```

Now that we are at the end of the lesson. Lets go over some practice problems and improve our skills with loops
