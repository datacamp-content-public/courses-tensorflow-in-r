Good morning everyone, in this lesson we will learn about loops. In programming loops repeats a command for a number of times. There are two types of loops. The next slide shows what a for loop looks like.


---
## For Loop

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "8ab4f140a7"
```

`@part1`
for (val in sequence)
{

statement

}


`@script`
After the for there is a sequence  and in between the brackets a statement will occur x amount of times depending on the length of the sequence

## For loop with Tensorflow

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "bc107f7482"
```

## Example of a For Loop

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "1aab9cae62"
```

`@part1`
for (val in sequence)
{
statement
}


`@script`

## While Loop

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2e20b66c8c"
```

`@part1`
Unlike the for loop the while loop repeats a command when certain conditions are met.  This comes in handy when

## Let's practice!

```yaml

Now that we are at the end of the lesson. Lets go over some practice problems and improve our skills with loops. In the next chapter we will go over estimators in Tensorflow.
