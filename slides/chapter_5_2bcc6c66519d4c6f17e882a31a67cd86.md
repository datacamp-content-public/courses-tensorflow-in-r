Good morning everyone, in this lesson we will learn about loops. In programming loops repeats a command for a number of times. There are two types of loops. The next slide shows what a for loop looks like.


---
## For Loop

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "8ab4f140a7"
```

`@part1`
for (val in sequence)
{

statement

}


`@script`
After the for there is a sequence  and in between the brackets a statement will occur x amount of times depending on the length of the sequence


---
## Example of a For Loop

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "1aab9cae62"
```

`@part1`
for (val in sequence)
{
statement
}


`@script`

## For loop with Tensorflow

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "bc107f7482"
```

`@part1`
library(tensorflow)
#Need tf Variable and set it to 0 
var_1 = tf$Variable(0, name="avr_1")
#Then use the tf.add function
add_op = tf$add(var_1, tf.constant(1))
# then use tf.assign
upd_op = tf.assign(var_1, add_op)

#Now start the session in a for loop
sess = tf$Session() 
sess$run(tf$global_variables_initializer())

with(tf$Session() %as% sess, {
  sess$run(tf$global_variables_initializer())
  for (i in 1:10)
    print(i)
})


`@script`

## Now incorporating for loop with tensorflow

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "812857e08b"
```

`@part1`
var_1 = tf$Variable(0, name="avr_1")

add_op = tf$add(var_1, tf.constant(1))

upd_op = tf.assign(var_1, add_op)

sess = tf$Session() 

sess$run(tf$global_variables_initializer())

with(tf$Session() %as% sess, {
  
  sess$run(tf$global_variables_initializer())
  
  for (i in 1:10)
  
  print(i)

})


`@script`

## While Loop

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2e20b66c8c"
```

`@part1`
Unlike the for loop the while loop repeats a command when certain conditions are met.  This comes in handy when


`@script`

## Example of a While Loop

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e84b524b91"

## While Loop with Tensorflow

## Advantages of using loops

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "9de0b20d6c"
```

Now that we are at the end of the lesson. Lets go over some practice problems and improve our skills with loops. In the next chapter we will go over estimators in Tensorflow.
