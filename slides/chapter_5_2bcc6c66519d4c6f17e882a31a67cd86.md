Good morning everyone, in this lesson we will learn about loops. In programming loops repeats a command for a number of times. It comes in handy when manipulating data in list/array. There are two types of loops. The next slide shows what a for loop looks like.


---
## Basic Structure of a For Loop

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "8ab4f140a7"
```

`@part1`
for (val in sequence)
{

statement

}


`@script`
The for loop has three components. The val is the initial value that before the for loop begins. The sequence determines the number of times the statement will occur. Once the val reaches a value that is beyond the sequence the statement will not occur. The next slide an example of a for loop.

## Example of a For Loop

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "1aab9cae62"
```

`@part1`
for (i in 1:10) {

  if (i %% 2){
  
next

  }
  
    print(i)
    
    }


`@script`
Here is an example of a for loop. The initial value is 0 and the sequence is the range from 1 to 10. The statement is if i is divisible by 2 print the i.

## For loop with Tensorflow

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "bc107f7482"
```

`@part1`
library(tensorflow)
#Need tf Variable and set it to 0 
var_1 = tf$Variable(0, name="avr_1")
#Then use the tf.add function
add_op = tf$add(var_1, tf.constant(1))
# then use tf.assign
upd_op = tf.assign(var_1, add_op)

#Now start the session in a for loop
sess = tf$Session() 
sess$run(tf$global_variables_initializer())

with(tf$Session() %as% sess, {
  sess$run(tf$global_variables_initializer())
  for (i in 1:10)
    print(i)
})


`@script`

## While Loop 

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2e20b66c8c"
```

`@part1`
x <- 1

   while(x < 5) {

x <- x+1; 

print(x);

}


`@script`
Unlike the for loop the while loop repeats a command when certain conditions are met. In this example the while loop will continue until x becomes 5. While loops come in handy when you are analyzing data in a list/array that meet certain criteria such as only dealing with values that are only even numbers.

## Advantages of using loops

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "6e31048807"
```

`@part1`
- Requires less time than done manually
- Good for automating processes
- Manipulating data in a list/sequence

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "9de0b20d6c"
```

`@script`
Now that we are at the end of the lesson. Lets go over some practice problems and improve our skills with loops. In the next chapter we will go over estimators in Tensorflow.
